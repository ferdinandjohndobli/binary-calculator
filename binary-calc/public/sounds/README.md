# Sound Files

The binary calculator uses the following sound effects:

- `click.mp3` - Button click sound
- `switch.mp3` - Theme or operation change sound
- `success.mp3` - Calculation success sound
- `error.mp3` - Error notification sound
- `clear.mp3` - Clear operation sound
- `confetti.mp3` - Celebratory sound when milestone calculations are reached

Due to file size constraints, the actual sound files aren't included in the repository. You can add your own sound files with these names to enable the sound effects feature.
